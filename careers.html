            <td>A Front-end Developer is responsible for creating the visual elements of a website or web application
                that users interact with directly. They use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and
                implement layouts, navigation, and user interfaces that are responsive and user-friendly. Their work
                also involves collaborating with UX/UI designers to ensure that design aesthetics align with
                functionality. Front-end developers often work with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build
                dynamic web pages, ensuring that the user experience is seamless across different devices and screen
                sizes.
                In addition to technical skills, front-end developers need a strong understanding of web accessibility,
                performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility. They are also involved in the ongoing testing
                and debugging of websites to ensure that they work efficiently and effectively. Collaboration with
                back-end developers is key, as the front-end must communicate with the server-side elements that power
                web applications, making it a critical role in the development of modern web platforms.

            <td>A Data Scientist analyzes large sets of structured and unstructured data to extract valuable insights
                that can inform business decisions. They use statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data
                visualization tools to uncover patterns and trends in data. Data scientists typically work with
                programming languages like Python, R, and SQL, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and
                TensorFlow to manipulate and analyze data. Their role often requires them to clean and preprocess data
                to make it usable, and then apply advanced analytics techniques to generate actionable recommendations
                or predictive models.
                Beyond technical expertise, a successful data scientist must have strong problem-solving abilities and
                the capacity to communicate complex data findings to non-technical stakeholders. They work closely with
                business teams to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and create models that forecast future
                outcomes, improve efficiency, or provide new insights. The role of a data scientist has become
                increasingly vital in industries like healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, where data-driven decisions
                can lead to competitive advantages.

                techniques, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep
                learning, to solve real-world problems. They work extensively with programming languages like Python,
                Java, or C++, and employ frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras to build and deploy ML models.
                ML engineers also need a solid understanding of mathematical concepts like statistics, probability,
                linear algebra, and optimization to create effective models.
                Machine learning engineers collaborate closely with data scientists to understand the problem and
                identify relevant data sources. Once the data is prepared, the engineer designs and fine-tunes models to
                improve accuracy and efficiency. They are also responsible for scaling models to handle large datasets,
                integrating models into production systems, and monitoring model performance over time. As machine
                learning becomes increasingly central to industries like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, ML
                engineers are in high demand to help businesses harness the power of AI.
